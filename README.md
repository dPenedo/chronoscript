# ChronoScript
## Description
ChronoScript is a web application that includes three sections:
1. **Stopwatch**
2. **Countdown** 
3. **World-times**

It's builded two times in separate directories:
1. **Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**. It has a retro style based on the venerable [Dracula theme](https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme)
2. **React + TypeScript**.


## Stopwatch Usage
Using the stopwatch is straightforward:
- The "Start" button has three modes:
    1. "Start" to begin the stopwatch
    2. "Stop" to halt the stopwatch
    3. "Pause" to temporarily pause the stopwatch
- The "Reset" button resets the stopwatch to zero.

## Countdown Timer Usage
Using the countdown timer is similar:
- The "Start" button has three modes:
    1. "Start" to begin the countdown
    2. "Stop" to halt the countdown
    3. "Pause" to temporarily pause the countdown
- The "Reset" button resets the countdown to zero.

## World Clock Usage
The world clock automatically detects your cityâ€™s timezone. You can select any city from the `Select a city` dropdown menu to view the current time in that location.
