# Chronostalgic
## Description
Chronostalgic is a retro-styled stopwatch application built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It has a retro style with a clear influence of the venerable Dracula theme, but the palette is slightly different. It has hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds.

## Usage
It's simple:
- The "Start" button has three modes:
        1. "Start", to begin the stopwatch
        2. "Stop", to stop the stopwatch
        3. "Pause", to pause the stopwatch
- The "Reset" button reset the stopwatch to zero.
