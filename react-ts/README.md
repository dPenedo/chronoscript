## React + TypeScript version

ChronoScript-React-ts stopwatch, countdown timer, and world clock application built with `React` + `TypeScript` with `Vite`. The application tracks hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds. This project is part of the [ChronoScript project](https://github.com/dpenedo/chronoscript), which also includes a version built with **React and TypeScript**.

## Stopwatch Usage

Using the stopwatch is straightforward:

-   The "Start" button has three modes:
    1. "Start" to begin the stopwatch
    2. "Stop" to halt the stopwatch
    3. "Pause" to temporarily pause the stopwatch
-   The "Reset" button resets the stopwatch to zero.

## Countdown Timer Usage

Using the countdown timer is similar:

-   The "Start" button has three modes:
    1. "Start" to begin the countdown
    2. "Stop" to halt the countdown
    3. "Pause" to temporarily pause the countdown
-   The "Reset" button resets the countdown to zero.

## World Clock Usage

The world clock automatically detects your cityâ€™s timezone. You can select any city from the `Select a city` dropdown menu to view the current time in that location.
