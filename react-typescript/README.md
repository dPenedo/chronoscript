# ChronoScript - React + TypeScript + Vite

## React Version version
ChronoScript-React is a stopwatch, countdown timer, and world clock application built with **Vite, TypeScript, and CSS modues**. It features a modern design inspired by the classic [Nord theme](https://www.nordtheme.com/). The application tracks hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds. This project is part of the [ChronoScript project](https://github.com/dpenedo/chronoscript), which also includes a version built with **Vanilla JavaScript**. In this version, testing is done with **Vitest**, in the *Vanilla* one, testin is done with *Jest*.  





## Stopwatch Usage
Using the stopwatch is straightforward:
- The "Start" button has three modes:
    1. "Start" to begin the stopwatch
    2. "Stop" to halt the stopwatch
    3. "Pause" to temporarily pause the stopwatch
- The "Reset" button resets the stopwatch to zero.

## Countdown Timer Usage
Using the countdown timer is similar:
- The "Start" button has three modes:
    1. "Start" to begin the countdown
    2. "Stop" to halt the countdown
    3. "Pause" to temporarily pause the countdown
- The "Reset" button resets the countdown to zero.

## World Clock Usage
The world clock automatically detects your cityâ€™s timezone. You can select any city from the `Select a city` dropdown menu to view the current time in that location.
